# 🚀 MCP Server Workshop Overview

Welcome to the **MCP Server Workshop** — where you'll go from idea to implementation using the **Model Context Protocol** and **Cloudflare Workers**.

By the end of this session, you’ll have built and deployed your own MCP server and connected it to Claude for real-world interaction.

---

## 🎯 Workshop Goals

By participating in this hands-on session, you will:

✅ **Understand MCP** – What it is and why it matters  
✅ **Build an MCP Server** – From scratch using Cloudflare's remote MCP template  
✅ **Deploy to Cloudflare** – Go live using Workers  
✅ **Connect to Claude** – Enable real-time interaction with your server  
✅ **Implement a Use Case** – Choose a practical scenario and make it work

## 🧠 What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that connects AI applications (like Claude) to tools, APIs, and data.

It gives AI agents the ability to:
- Pull **real-time data**
- Perform **actions** in external systems
- Maintain **contextual workflows**
- Use a **standard integration layer** across different tools

### ✅ Developer Benefits
- Write once, use across multiple AI clients
- Works serverlessly via Cloudflare Workers
- Offers built-in structure: tools, resources, prompts, sampling
- Fast to prototype, powerful to scale

### MCP Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   AI Client     │◄──►│   MCP Server    │◄──►│  Data Sources   │
│  (Claude, etc.) │    │  (Your Code)    │    │ (APIs, DBs, etc)│
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Core Components

1. **Resources**: Static or dynamic content (files, web pages, database records)
2. **Tools**: Functions that can be executed by the AI
3. **Prompts**: Reusable prompt templates
4. **Sampling**: AI model interaction capabilities

## 🎯 Use Cases We'll Explore

### 1. Travel Planner
- **Tools**: Search flights, hotels, attractions
- **Resources**: Travel guides, weather data
- **Real-world value**: Personalized travel recommendations

### 2. Restaurant Reservation
- **Tools**: Check availability, make reservations
- **Resources**: Menu data, restaurant information
- **Real-world value**: Streamlined dining experiences

### 3. Meeting Summary
- **Tools**: Analyze transcripts, extract action items
- **Resources**: Meeting templates, participant data
- **Real-world value**: Automated meeting follow-ups


## 🏆 Success Criteria

You'll know you've succeeded when:
- [ ] Your MCP server responds to initialization requests
- [ ] Tools can be listed and executed
- [ ] Resources can be read and accessed
- [ ] Claude can successfully connect to your server
- [ ] Your use case works end-to-end

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Skipping Validation**: Always validate input parameters
- **Ignoring CORS**: Cloudflare Workers need proper CORS headers
- **Hardcoding Values**: Use environment variables for configuration
- **Poor Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages
