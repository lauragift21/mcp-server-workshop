# 🚀 Build and Deploy Remote MCP Servers with Cloudflare

Welcome to the hands-on workshop where you'll build and deploy Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers using **Cloudflare Workers**.

## 🧠 What You'll Build

You'll create your own MCP server that connects to Claude (or any MCP-compatible client) and deploy it globally using Cloudflare. By the end, you'll have a real-world, AI-integrated use case running in production!
